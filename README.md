# IoT-Home-Automation-using-Blynk-NodeMCU-ESP8266


In this Home Automation System, we will control 2 home appliances as Fan, Bulb, Motor connected to the Relay using Blynk Application. The Wifi Module NodeMCU ESP8266 will Receive commands from the smartphone wirelessly through the internet. To encode the ON/OFF signal and send it to Server and to ESP8266 Board we need the best IoT Platform. So we chose Blynk as no other application can be better than this one. This project requires internet connectivity & canâ€™t work without Internet connection.
We have to do in interfacing using MIT App Inventor.
